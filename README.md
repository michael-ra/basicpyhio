# Basic python 

We implemented an ANN with Keras which is supposed to predict whether a person has diabetes based on a dataset from UCI Machine Learning. 
We used an online tutorial to get started (https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/) and built on that. Additionally, we included different visualizations for the data and the learning process.

## Requirements
In order to properly run our code you have to have installed:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - tensorflow
  - sklearn
  - seaborn
  - pandas
  - pydot
  
## How to use our program
Since our code is written in a Jupyter Notebook, one can follow our code naturally by running every cell succesively.
