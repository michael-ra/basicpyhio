# Our Programming Journey

## The Journey
We first decided to do a weather prediction with LSTMs which was a quite spontanous decision. It has been clear from the start that our experience level in deep learning was very different from person to person. Nevertheless we decided to go with this topic planning that the experienced group members could work with the model and the LSTMs whereas the the not so much experienced group members
would work on data preprocessing and plotting whilest learning about deep learning from the others.

Unfortunately, this idea did not work out as planned, so we decided that we needed a project on which everybody of the group could work on. Hence we changed from wheather predictions and LSTMs to prediction of diabetes with Keras. 
We chose Jupyter notebook as a medium for our code because it leads the reader through our code step by step, it shows directly our results and it gives us the opportunity to
add cells for the description of our code.

## Problems we faced
In the last days of the project we faced a lot more time pressure than we had expected. This was due to the fact that all of us had other obligations inside and outside university which
turned out to be highly time consuming. Thankfully, the tutors granted us a short deadline extension so we could finish up our project.
Moreover we had long lasting problems with our tensorflow model, whose accuracy would not increase over 70% whatever we changed in the architecture.
This problem could be solved in the end by adjusting the initial learning rate and the decay steps.

## What we learned
It goes without saying that we all learned a lot about working with ANNs and tensorflow. Naturally, especially the ones of us who have not worked with tensorflow before could gain a huge 
amount of new experience during the project. But also working with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn has offered many opportunities to improve our python skills (eg. making facet plots, learning different 
ways of summarizing data, prevent working unintentionally with copys, customizing seaborn plots,...etc.)

## Conclusion
Our final project contains a broad variety of python libraries some of which we got to know in the Basic Python course and others which we had to learn by ourselves.
But given the relative complexity of the project and the large number of different approaches we used, we are quite proud of what we archieved together in a quite stressful 
period of time and we are satisfied with what we can hand in for evaluation.
